  "intro": "You walk into Ms. Chen's classroom after school to work on your science project about renewable energy. The room is quieter than usual, with only a few students scattered at different tables. Your project partner, Kai, is already there setting up materials near the window.\n\nAs you approach, you notice Elena sitting alone at a nearby table. She has books and papers spread out but keeps glancing over at you and Kai. Her usual project partner, Devon, is absent today according to the note on the whiteboard.",

Elena closes her textbook and walks over to your table. \"Hey, I was wondering if you two might have room for one more person today? Devon's sick and I really need to get some work done on our solar panel model.\" Kai looks up from organizing the craft supplies and glances between you and Elena.",

The afternoon sunlight streams through the classroom windows, and you can hear other students in the hallway heading home. Tomorrow Devon will be back, and you'll see how both projects turn out for the science fair next week.",
