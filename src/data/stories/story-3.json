  "intro": "You arrive at school early on science fair day, excited to set up your volcano project in the gym. The hallways echo with your footsteps as you carry your supplies toward the gymnasium. When you push through the double doors, you notice something strange.\n\nYour assigned table sits empty, but scattered around it are pieces of what looks like a broken model solar system. Across the gym, you see Kai frantically searching through a box of materials while Maya stands nearby, holding a crumpled piece of paper. The gym teacher, Mr. Rodriguez, is setting up chairs at the far end of the room.",

      "prompt": "You set your volcano materials on your table and look more closely at the scattered pieces. Some appear to be painted planets, and there's a bent wire that might have held them in orbit. Kai looks up from his box and catches your eye, then glances toward Maya, who is now reading the crumpled paper more carefully.\n\nThe science fair doesn't start for another hour, but other students will begin arriving soon to set up their projects.",

She walks over to where the planet pieces are scattered and kneels down, comparing something on the paper to the broken pieces. Kai closes his box and starts walking toward the gym exit, but stops when he sees Maya examining the debris.\n\n\"I thought I put everything away safely last night,\" Maya says, though she's speaking quietly and you're not sure if she's talking to herself or to someone else.",

The closet door is slightly ajar, and you can see boxes and project supplies stacked inside.

Maya has managed to create a new display using her detailed drawings and the salvageable planet pieces, while Kai helps her explain the solar system to visitors. Your volcano demonstration draws a small crowd, and you notice Mr. Rodriguez making notes on his clipboard as he moves between the projects. The morning unfolds with presentations, questions, and the excited chatter of discovery.",
