  "intro": "You arrive at Riverside Community Center for your Saturday volunteer shift at the community garden. The morning air is crisp, and you can see your breath as you walk toward the tool shed. Ms. Rodriguez, the garden coordinator, usually meets volunteers here at 9 AM sharp, but today the area seems unusually quiet.\n\nAs you approach the main garden beds, you notice something strange. Several of the newly planted tomato seedlings that were thriving yesterday now appear wilted and brown. The soil around them looks disturbed, with small holes scattered throughout the bed. You hear footsteps behind you and turn to see Kai and Zara, two other regular volunteers, walking up the gravel path with confused expressions.",

      "prompt": "Kai points to the damaged plants and says, \"This wasn't like this yesterday when we left.\" Zara kneels down near one of the holes and examines it closely. \"Look at these marks in the dirt,\" she says. \"Something definitely dug here.\" You notice a small garden spade lying near the compost bin that wasn't there before, and you can see fresh dirt clinging to its blade.\n\nThe three of you exchange glances, clearly puzzled by what might have happened overnight.",

She walks briskly toward your group, but stops short when she sees the damaged garden bed.\n\n\"Oh my,\" she says, setting down her mug on a nearby bench. \"I was hoping I wouldn't find this.\" Kai asks what she means, and Ms. Rodriguez sighs. \"I got a call from the night security guard around midnight. He said he saw some unusual activity in the garden area, but by the time he came to check, everything seemed normal.\"",

      "prompt": "Ms. Rodriguez explains that the security guard mentioned seeing small moving shadows near the garden beds, but assumed it was just cats or other animals. As she speaks, you notice movement in the nearby bushes that border the garden. A rustling sound draws everyone's attention to a patch of overgrown shrubs near the fence.\n\nZara whispers, \"There's definitely something in there.\" You can see the branches moving, even though there's no wind. Ms. Rodriguez takes a step closer to the bushes, her clipboard held protectively in front of her.",

  "ending": "A small brown rabbit hops out from the bushes, followed by two smaller ones. Ms. Rodriguez laughs and shakes her head. \"Well, that explains the holes and the damaged seedlings,\" she says. \"Looks like we have some new neighbors who discovered our garden.\" The rabbits pause for a moment, then bound away toward the far end of the community center property. Kai suggests building a small fence around the vegetable beds, and Ms. Rodriguez nods, making notes on her clipboard. The morning volunteer work begins with a new project to plan.",
