  "title": "The Science Lab Mystery",
  "intro": "You arrive at Lincoln Middle School early on a Tuesday morning for Science Club. The hallways are still mostly empty as you walk toward Mr. Chen's lab on the second floor. Science Club usually starts at 7:30 AM, giving members time to work on projects before first period begins.\n\nAs you push open the lab door, you notice something unusual. The row of plant experiments that club members have been growing for the past month looks different. Several of the bean sprouts in their labeled cups appear wilted, and the soil in their containers looks disturbed. You see Emma and Marcus, two other club members, already standing by the experiment table with puzzled looks on their faces.",

      "prompt": "Emma gestures toward the wilted plants and says, \"These were healthy yesterday afternoon when we watered them.\" Marcus bends down to examine one of the cups more closely. \"The soil is completely dry in some of these,\" he observes. \"And look, some of the cups have been moved from their original positions.\" You notice the lab's watering can is on the floor near the supply closet instead of in its usual spot by the sink, and there are small water droplets leading from the sink toward the experiment table.\n\nAll three of you look around the lab, trying to understand what might have happened.",

      "prompt": "Before your group can investigate further, the lab door opens and Mr. Chen walks in carrying his briefcase and a stack of papers. He pauses when he sees the three of you gathered around the experiment table, then his expression shifts when he notices the condition of the plants.\n\n\"I was hoping this wouldn't happen,\" he says, setting down his things on his desk. Marcus asks what he means. Mr. Chen explains, \"The custodian called me last night. He said he heard noises coming from the science wing around 8 PM, but when he checked, the doors were all locked and the lights were off.\"",

      "prompt": "Mr. Chen mentions that the custodian described hearing scratching sounds and what sounded like something small moving around. As he speaks, you notice movement near the window. The blinds are swaying slightly, even though the window appears closed. Emma whispers and points toward the supply closet, where you can see the door is slightly ajar.\n\nYou can hear a faint rustling sound coming from inside the closet. Marcus takes a step back, but Mr. Chen moves toward the closet door, his hand extended to pull it open.",

  "ending": "The closet door swings open to reveal a small gray squirrel, which immediately darts between Mr. Chen's legs and heads for the window. Emma quickly opens the window, and the squirrel leaps onto the outside ledge before scurrying down the tree branch that touches the building. Mr. Chen laughs and points to a small gap in the window frame. \"That explains everything,\" he says. \"Our little visitor must have been coming and going through here.\" The Science Club begins their morning with a new task: documenting the experience and figuring out how to protect their experiments from future wildlife visits."
