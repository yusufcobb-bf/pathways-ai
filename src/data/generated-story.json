  "intro": "You arrive at school early on Wednesday morning to check on your science fair project one last time before the judging begins. The hallway is quiet, with only a few teachers preparing their classrooms. You walk toward the display tables set up in the main corridor where all the projects are arranged.\n\nAs you approach your assigned spot, you notice something strange. Your volcano model is there, but the data chart you spent weeks creating is missing. The colorful poster showing your experiment results was taped right next to the volcano yesterday afternoon. Now there's just an empty space on the table.",

Near the gym entrance, you spot Zara organizing papers at a table covered with what looks like multiple project displays.\n\nYour chart could be anywhere, and the judging starts in less than two hours.",
