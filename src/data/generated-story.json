The lunch line is getting shorter, and most students already have their food. Kai keeps checking his pockets and looking around nervously.\n\n'I can't find my lunch money anywhere,' Kai says quietly, running his hands through his backpack one more time. 'I know I had it this morning.' You have enough money for your own lunch plus a little extra that your mom gave you for emergencies.",
