  "intro": "Your class has been chosen to help create a new community garden in the empty lot next to your school. Everyone is excited about planting vegetables and flowers that the whole neighborhood can enjoy. The project will take several weeks, and today is the first day of planning.\n\nAs you walk into the classroom, you notice that the desks have been arranged in small groups. Mrs. Chen explains that each group will be responsible for designing and caring for one section of the garden. You look around and see some of your close friends already sitting together, but you also notice Alex sitting alone at a table, looking hopeful that someone will join.",

There's one empty seat left. At the same time, you see Alex sitting alone, organizing some seed packets they brought from home. Alex has great ideas but is often quiet in group settings.",

  "ending": "As the weeks pass, the community garden begins to take shape. Each group's section reflects the different choices and efforts that went into planning and caring for it. Neighbors start stopping by to see the progress, and some even offer to help with watering during weekends. The project becomes more than just a school assignment—it becomes a space where the whole community can come together. When the first vegetables are ready to harvest, your class decides to donate them to the community center, and everyone feels proud of what they've accomplished together."
